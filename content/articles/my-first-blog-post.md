Austere engineering is an approach to reach blissful software engineering productivity by avoiding the indulgent aspects of common software development lifecycles. 

The worship of status reporting and the temptations of vanity metrics have led us astray from the purity of of the work.  What is simple is both sufficient and efficient. 

Austere engineering may not be for everyone and we all take our own paths.  Clarity can only be found through reflection.  Be inspired, not dogmatic, and transform software delivery capability delivery at your organization.
# The Principles of Austere Engineering

## Force Majeure
Eh… The world has an irresistible compulsion to change, and we fixate on artifacts like roadmaps, OKRs, and Gantt charts into your software development process hold you back from changing priorities. 

## Flow State of Being
Flow is the ideal state of being.  Any interruptions that limit flow need to be identified day by day.  

Waiting to address problems in a scheduled meeting like retrospectives, timed feedback sessions, or engagement surveys is too late.
## Tautological Blockers
Whatever is limiting progress is what limits progress.

Stop looking for answers in secondary or tertiary behaviors like worrying about what is a bug of a feature.
## Progress Reporting is Tension
Forcing developers to report on progress is stressful and tense.

Even the best developers face setbacks.  

Nobody likes disappointing their managers and peers by reporting on delays.  

We shouldn’t be forcing ourselves needless stress to report on something that is easily available in from other streams of information. 

## Be Present
Let the past be the past.

Overfitting the measurements of previous success to predict future success lacks meaning.

Historical flow, velocity, hours, or has little to do with the present reality of your systems. 

The world changes, and so does your software.  Brand new shiny clean code gets muddied by leaky abstractions, technical debt, and natural churn.

People and their expertise come and go. Languages, frameworks, and libraries come and go. The skills that helped ship version 1.0 of your app won't be there for 1.2.


Equanimity 
—---------------------

No Estimation Metrics
Counting completed work items is good enough to project into the future.  Using points, time estimates, t-shirt sizes, or other magic measurements are distractions.  Make every piece of work about the same size.
Realistic Projections
We provide projections for six weeks out.  Anything more than that is useless speculation.  
If you need more than six weeks of scheduling, you are doing Waterfall.  
If hitting deadlines are important to you, then you should be more comfortable with reducing scope or moving that date.
A perfect a project plan doesn't guarantee timely delivery.
If you think Gannt charts help create software, please use another tool.
Austere.app is for coordinating developers, not mapping out product strategy.
Small Nimble Teams 
Team of 3-5 people is the sweet spot. Keeping more than five people aligned is hard.
