# Austere Engineering

Austere engineering is an approach to reach blissful software engineering productivity by avoiding the indulgent aspects of common software development lifecycles. 

The worship of status reporting and the temptations of vanity metrics have led us astray from the purity required to deliver value with software. 

The four main ideas of austere engineering:

 * Vanity metrics lead to temptation.
 * Let the past be the past.
 * What is simple is both sufficient and efficient. 
 * Status reporting is tension.

Austere engineering may not be for everyone, and we all take our own paths.  Clarity can only be found through reflection.  Be inspired, not dogmatic, and transform software delivery capability delivery at your organization.
## The Ideals
### Vanity Metrics Lead to Temptation
Teams are tempted to gauge success or failure by looking at metrics.

Velocity, cycle time, lead time, time tracking, bug rates, and other metrics are not only easily manipulated, but lack the context and meaning to provide clarity and understanding.

We gaze at alluring and handsomely designed charts and graphs and allow ourselves to be comforted by an illusion of reality instead of seeking the discomfort of asking tough questions. 

### Be Present; Let the Past be the Past

The world changes, and so does your software.  

The industry overfits on previous successes and we often rely on pattern matching, decision shortcutting, and perspectives and experiences that may not fit the reality of today.

Brand new shiny clean code gets muddied by leaky abstractions, technical debt, and natural churn.  People and their expertise come and go. Languages, frameworks, and libraries spring up like flowers in the spring and die in the fall. The skills that helped ship version 1.0 of your app won't be there for 1.2.
