# Austere Engineering

Austere engineering is an approach to reach blissful software engineering productivity by avoiding the indulgent aspects of common software development lifecycles. 

The worship of status reporting and the temptations of vanity metrics have led us astray from the purity of expanding business capabilities and delivering value with software. 

Austere engineering may not be for everyone, and we all take our own paths.  Clarity can only be found through reflection.  Be inspired, not dogmatic, and transform software delivery capability delivery at your organization.

* Vanity metrics lead to temptation.
* Let the past be the past.
* What is simple is both sufficient and efficient. 
* Status reporting is tension.

## Principles of Austere Engineering
### Embrace Force Majeure
The world has an irresistible compulsion to change.

The fixation on linking software development to roadmaps, OKRs, and Gantt charts blurs your vision.

## Optimize for Flow
Flow is the ideal state of being.  Remove any interruptions that limit flow.  

Waiting to address interruptions to flow in scheduled meetings like retrospectives, timed feedback sessions, or engagement surveys is too late.


## Seek Tautological Blockers
Whatever is limiting progress is what limits progress.

Searching for easy answers behaviors 
## Status Reporting is Unsafe Tension
Forcing developers to report on progress is stressful and tense.

Even the best developers face setbacks, and nobody likes disappointing their managers and peers by explaining they are behind.

Status information is readily available from other streams of information. 

## Be Present
Let the past be the past.

Data about previous success to predict future success lacks meaning.
